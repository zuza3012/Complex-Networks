Program creates a Erdos-Renyi graph in two different ways:
1) traditionally - by randomly filling the adjajency matrix with proper probability
2) using Monte Carlo algorithm - Metropolis

The comparison between two methods is shown in the p.png file (degree distribution).
File metropolis.png shows the creaton of "stable" graph, where mean value of edges
<E> is constant in time.
